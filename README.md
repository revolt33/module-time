# module-time
This is a mini project made to track my actual project. It helps me track the time spent on individual modules of project.

* To use this project create a database in mysql and then import the sql file into this database through phpmyadmin.

* Open the process.php file and edit username and password of the database in selectDatabase() method and also set the database name in next line.

* Move this folder with all the files inside www folder of your wamp server and you're good to go.

* Just when you're about to add a new task open a browser tab and open this project folder through WAMP server and add a task.

* Click to pause a task when you're about to take a break and click resume the task when you resume an existing task.

* Click to stop the task when you'r done with a module.
